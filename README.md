# FSDA

## Introduction

This is a sample web application that showcases a possible implementation for a system that manages user's physiological data.
The application is meant to run in a PHP web server and is compatible with the main HTML5 compatible browsers.

## Install

To install FSDA on your web server, simply copy the git repository into your web server http directory. 
Your Server should have PHP 5.5+ installed to make this work properly.
The web application will then be accessible via the web directory of your url. E.g.:

http://{HOSTNAME}/web

## Login
This web application doesn't have a connection to a database, which should be implemented separately.
Instead, there are some default login credentials to be used:

    Users:
    mario@rossi.com / password
    maria@bianchi.com / password
    
    Doctor:
    gregory@house.com / password
    
    Support:
    support@support.com / support
    
    Admin:
    admin@admin.com / admin
